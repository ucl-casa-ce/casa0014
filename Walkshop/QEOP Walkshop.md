# QEOP Walkshop
   
**Purpose of visit**
  
**Last Drop Intro to Qeop.**

On site of 2012 Olympic Games — area used to have largest pile of refrigerators in Europe - lots of remediation work over the decades before the games

LLDC London Legacy Development Corporation is the Planning Authority for Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and parts of the areas surrounding it

Created through a pledge made in the original Olympic bid “This pledge concerns the physical legacy of the Games – the long-term planning, development, management and maintenance of the Park and its impact on the surrounding area after the London 2012 Games.” LLDC website

They are a Mayoral Development Corporation and therefore directly accountable to Londoners through the Mayor of London.

They work closely with a number of organisations including the Mayor of London, the Greater London Authority, central government, the East London Host Boroughs, residents in neighbouring local communities, local organisations, businesses and regeneration agencies and national and international sporting, cultural and leisure organisations.

**SSD Smart sustainable district**

In 2014 started working with LLDC on their “SSD” programme - Intel and UCL

Sensors and IoT / ViLo

Register of projects in their pipeline

2024 we have the digital frontiers work with SHIFT / LLDC

----

**Bridge near Bat7 - Site access Biometrics**

AECPCR - visualizing planning data

Trades on site etc

----

**Bridge - Wifi Spark AP’s and people counting**

30ish APs around park

Run by company for LLDC - provide public WiFi across cities

Capture page so we have devices white listed

They are doing people counting trials

----

**UHI sensor on the way back - near copper box**

Mandy's PhD project - LoRaWAN Heat Sensor: This sensor monitors air temperature and humidity every 5 minutes to assess London’s Urban Heat Islands and Heatwave. Powered by NiMH batteries and solar panel, it is low cost- lightweight and self managing with data sent using the LoRaWAN network. It has been deployed with both the Greater London Authority and SHIFT to aid the creation of a citywide microclimate network for climate mitigation planning by identifying hotspots and cool zones across London.

**Near water over carpenters road bridge**

Water quality sensor

Plugged in near pub

Vandalized

**Under orbit - Lora GW**

2015 Intel Kerlink - coverage analysis across park

Not as good as hoped

Next stage to install a Things Network GW this year

----
**UCL Bridge to finish.**

Talk about PSW and Marshgate

-----
**Home work task**

On your journey home look out for examples of IoT in the wild.

Take pictures and complete one slide using the template on the week 3 Moodle page.

Create a second slide with a sketch of an imaginary device that you wish existed in the city. You MUST include a sketch on your slides - it cannot just be words (but can be both).

Upload a copy of your slides to Moodle week 3 page
